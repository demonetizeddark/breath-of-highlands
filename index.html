            <h2>Greener Than Tea</h2>
              <p>
                  We believe it's important to bring enlightenment to eco-friendly solutions that can not only better our environment, but also bring a more natural feel to coffee, all the way down to the bean. 
              </p>
              <p>
                  Roasting such beans is an art to Scots, so we intend to handle every bean with care. One way we intend to make our operation eco-friendly is not by throwing away the beans, but rather by using them for composting as they add benefits to the soil.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Talking about being eco-friendly, we also plan on using renewable energy—such as solar and wind energy—to power the buildings used for manufacturing, farming, and serving. We will also be using either recyclable or biodegradable materials when it comes to producing items such as to-go cups, drink carriers, and straws.
              </p>
              <p>
                  We do also offer vegan and organic dairy options for anyone who's into that sorta thing.

          <h2>Nature At Its Finest</h2>
          <p>In terms of price, there's a lot to throw around. We'll start with how much we're going to spend.</p>
          <p>We plan on setting the prices for minimal, small, medium, and large sizes to $2, $2.50, $3, and $3.50 respectively. Customers can pay with either actual money or with Merks, our points in our rewards system. Each dollar equals two Merks and these merks can be used to earn free drinks, coffee beans, or with a little bit of love, free mugs. We plan on starting off with the little things and expanding over time after a certain threshold is met each time. Regarding our establishments, we plan to have wi-fi available for anyone who needs it, wireless charging pads for convenience, and a comfortable environment not just for coffee drinkers and college students, but also for event organizers, businessmen/businesswomen, et cetera.</p>

            <h2>Ding-Dong Ditch The Hassle</h2>
            <p>
                We understand what it's like to have to wait 15 minutes in a packed coffee shop. Not to mention going through the hassle of remembering and repeating a complex order. Maybe you're one of those people that just wants to grab your coffee and get the heck out of there. Even having to wait forever in a drive thru you can't back out of can be a pain. Believe us, we've been to Starbucks and Dutch Bros, we know that hassle.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why we're designing our app with an easy-to-understand user interface. A UI that makes navigation through the app quickly and easily relieves the hassle that other food apps shouldn't have in the first place. The UI is customizable and equipped with a dark mode that can be set individually, by time of day, or just follow what the device's settings are. A custom accent colour can be set that shows throughout the app, and there's even an option to set a background; you can use any of the given backgrounds, or you can upload your own, the option is yours.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're also integrating a barcode generation feature that allows people to scan in-house and automatically pull up the order or save it as soon as you make it up! While we're on the topic of ordering, you can connect your card to your account for online orders, as well as allowing for ordering and purchasing in the same barcode.

            <h2>Highland Security 101</h2>
            <p>
                When it comes to account security, we believe that you have a right to privacy. Hell, we care about privacy as much as the next company <em>(other than Facebook)</em>. Which is why we will allow you the option to prompt a fingerprint and/or facial recognition scan <em>(depending on model of phone)</em> upon opening the app every time or after a set amount of time.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; text-indent:0; font-size: 20px;font-size: 3vw;">
                <strong>WE WILL NOT ASK FOR YOUR ACCOUNT/PERSONAL DETAILS. <br> WE WILL NOT SHARE YOUR ACCOUNT/PERSONAL DETAILS.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will provide a password and email reset link or code via your email or phone number should you forget your password or email used. If you recieve a suspicious looking email from an address that is <strong>NOT</strong> from <strong>noreply@highlands.com</strong>, that is most definitely not us and someone trying to take your account for themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Should anyone use your account without your permission, you will get a prompt in your email or your app if a purchase you made was or wasn't you. If it wasn't, the purchase will be void, the money will be refunded, and the device used by the unauthorized person to make the purchase will be removed from your account and permanently barred from accessing it again.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>But what if I accidentally purchased something?</q>
                Don't worry, you can choose to reverse a purchase with a simple button in the confirmation screen after a purchase was made. We'll know the difference between an unauthorized purchase and a simple mistake.

          <h2>As For The Sharks,</h2>
          <p>the deal I would like to propose is one I feel could benefit both of us in the process. The proposition that I am presenting to you is 15% of the company for $150,000.</p>
          <p>I feel that my business can accomplish many things not only with being eco-friendly, but also without the major hassle. Within the next 5 years, I see it with marginally more establishments, allowing for more people to experience nature at it's finest.</p>
